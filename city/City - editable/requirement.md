# Dynamic Animated City Background Scene

## Objective
Create a dynamic, animated city background scene rendered inside a 1905px wide and 520px high HTML container. The scene simulates a lively urban environment that visually responds to configurable parameters such as time of day, number of buildings, windows, and people.

## Visual Layout Structure

### Top Section – Sky
- Gradient background representing daytime or nighttime sky.
- Changes based on the current or hardcoded time.

### Middle Section – City Buildings
- Multiple buildings of random heights and widths.
- Each building has a grid of small windows.
- At night, a random subset of windows are lit.

### Walkway
- A designated horizontal strip between the bottom of buildings and the road.
- Acts as a pedestrian path where people walk.
- People (stick figures) are confined to this area for movement.

### Bottom Section – Roadway
- A main road at the very bottom.
- Two side roads on the left and right sides for added realism.
- Streetlights along the road that glow at night.

## Dynamic Behavior

### People Animation
- Stick figure representations of people are generated in configurable/random numbers.
- They walk from right to left within the walkway.
- Once a person moves past the left edge, they re-enter from the right.
- Occasionally, people group together and pause to simulate conversation.

### Lighting Conditions
- Based on the current or configured hour:
  - **Daytime:** Bright sky, unlit windows, inactive streetlights.
  - **Nighttime:** Dark sky, randomly lit windows, glowing streetlights.

## Configuration Options (via JavaScript config object)
- `buildings`: Number of buildings to render (default: random).
- `people`: Number of animated people (default: random).
- `windowsPerBuilding`: Number of windows per building (default: random).
- `time`: Hour of the day to simulate lighting conditions (default: current hour).

## Technology Stack
- **HTML:** Structure for the city container.
- **CSS:** Styling of buildings, windows, road, walkway, and animations.
- **jQuery (JavaScript):** DOM manipulation, random generation, and animation logic.
